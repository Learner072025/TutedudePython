# ASSIGNMENT 1:
Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
 
**Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations** <br>
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.<br>

Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:

Enter the first number: 5<br>
Enter the second number: 2

Addition: 7<br>
Subtraction: 3<br>
Multiplication: 10<br>
Division: 2.5
 
**Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting**<br>
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.<br>

Expected Output:
The program should output a greeting like:

Enter your First name: John<br>
Enter your Last name: Doe<br>

Hello, John Doe! Welcome to Python program.

# ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
**Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.<br>

Expected Output:
The program should return an output like:

Enter a number: 7<br>
7 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 12<br>
12 is an even number.

**Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.
 
Expected Output:
The program should return:
 
Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
